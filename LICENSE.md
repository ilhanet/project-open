# GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
### Version 3, 19 November 2007  

Copyright (C) 2025 Ilhanet. 

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  

## Preamble  

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender them. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it:  

1. You must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  
2. You must ensure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  
3. You must show them these terms so they know their rights.  

Developers that use the GNU AGPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify it.

### **4. Remote Network Interaction**  
If you run the modified software as a network service, you must provide users access to the modified source code.
